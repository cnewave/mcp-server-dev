# MCP Server

## Overview

MCP (Managed Communication Protocol) Server is a modern, scalable, and secure communication protocol server designed to facilitate seamless interactions between clients and services. This development repository contains the source code, documentation, and tools necessary for setting up and extending the MCP server infrastructure.

## Concept

The MCP server is built around several core concepts:

### 1. Managed Communication

MCP provides a standardized way to handle communication between different systems, applications, and services. It abstracts away the complexities of network protocols, serialization formats, and connection management, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

### 2. Protocol Agnostic

The server is designed to support multiple protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, gRPC, etc.) through a unified interface. This allows clients to connect using their preferred protocol while the server handles the translation and routing.

### 3. Service Discovery

MCP includes built-in service discovery mechanisms that allow services to register themselves and clients to discover available services dynamically.

### 4. Security First

Security is a fundamental aspect of MCP, with features including:
- End-to-end encryption
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging

### 5. Scalability

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to add more server instances as your load increases.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Redis (optional, for caching)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

### Basic Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cnewave/mcp-server-dev.git
cd mcp-server-dev
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure the server**

Copy the example configuration file and modify it according to your environment:

```bash
cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
```

Edit `config/config.json` to set your database connection, security settings, and other options.

4. **Run the server**

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Docker Installation

1. **Build and start the containers**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the MCP server along with MongoDB and Redis instances.

### Production Deployment

For production environments, we recommend:

1. Using environment variables instead of configuration files
2. Setting up proper monitoring and logging
3. Configuring a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) for SSL termination
4. Implementing proper backup strategies for the database

Example production startup:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production \
DB_URI=mongodb://user:password@mongodb:27017/mcp \
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key \
npm start
```

## Configuration Options

The MCP server can be configured through a combination of:
- Configuration files
- Environment variables
- Command line arguments

Key configuration options include:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `port` | Server listening port | 3000 |
| `dbUri` | MongoDB connection string | mongodb://localhost:27017/mcp |
| `logLevel` | Logging verbosity | info |
| `authSecret` | Secret for JWT tokens | (required) |
| `corsOrigins` | Allowed CORS origins | * |

## Next Steps

After installation, you might want to:

1. Create your first service
2. Set up authentication
3. Configure client connections
4. Explore the API documentation
